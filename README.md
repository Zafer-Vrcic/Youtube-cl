 <h2>Youtube-cl</h2>


<p>  Greetings to everyone, the site you see in the video is youtube clone.<br>

-It was written in a responsive way using tailwind. Frankly, it provided great convenience.<br>
-Routes were determined using the react-router-dom library.<br>
- An asynchronous structure was created by making requests with axios and the API was pulled.<br>
- Milift and moment libraries were used for dates and numbers. <br>
-Finally, react-player was used to reflect the video on the interface.
</p>

<p> A very productive clone project. On the one hand, you can check the designs and practice with tailwind. In addition, it is very useful in terms of practice on how to communicate with the backend via API and how to pull the APIs. <p>

<p>You can see more details about the hooks used and how they are used by clicking on my Github link. <p>
